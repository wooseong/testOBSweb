[![Build Status - Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/Palakis/obs-websocket)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Palakis/obs-websocket/history) [![Build Status - Linux & OS X](https://travis-ci.org/Palakis/obs-websocket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Palakis/obs-websocket)

## Downloads
Binaries for Windows and Linux are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/releases) section.

## Using obs-websocket
A web client and frontend made by [t2t2](https://github.com/t2t2/obs-tablet-remote) (compatible with tablets and other touch interfaces) is available here : http://t2t2.github.io/obs-tablet-remote/

It is **highly recommended** to protect obs-websocket with a password against unauthorized control. To do this, open the "Websocket server settings" dialog under OBS' "Tools" menu. In the settings dialogs, you can enable or disable authentication and set a password for it.

### Possible use cases
- Remote control OBS from a phone or tablet on the same local network
- Change your stream overlay/graphics based on the current scene (like the AGDQ overlay does)
- Automate scene switching with a third-party program (e.g. : auto-pilot, foot pedal, ...)

### For developers

The server is a typical Websockets server running by default on port 4444 (the port number can be changed in the Settings dialog).
The protocol understood by the server is documented in [PROTOCOL.md](docs/generated/protocol.md).  

Here's a list of available language APIs for obs-websocket :
- Javascript (browser & nodejs): [obs-websocket-js](https://github.com/haganbmj/obs-websocket-js) by Brendan Hagan
- C#/VB.NET: [obs-websocket-dotnet](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket-dotnet)
- Python 2 and 3: [obs-websocket-py](https://github.com/Elektordi/obs-websocket-py) by Guillaume Genty a.k.a Elektordi
- Python 3.5+ with asyncio: [obs-ws-rc](https://github.com/KirillMysnik/obs-ws-rc) by Kirill Mysnik
- Java 8+: [obs-websocket-java](https://github.com/Twasi/websocket-obs-java) by TwasiNET

I'd like to know what you're building with or for obs-websocket. If you do something in this fashion, feel free to drop me an email at `stephane /dot/ lepin /at/ gmail /dot/ com` !

## Compiling obs-websocket

See the [build instructions](BUILDING.md).

## Contributing

### Branches

The two main development branches are:

- `4.x-current`: actively-maintained codebase for 4.x releases. Backwards-compatible (unless stated otherwise) with existing clients until 5.0.
- `5.x`: upcoming 5.0 version

**New features and fixes must be based off and contributed to `4.x-current`**, as obs-websocket 5.0 is not in active development yet.

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests must never be based off your fork's main branch (in our case, `4.x-current` or `5.x`). Start your work in a new branch
based on the main one (e.g.: `cool-new-feature`, `fix-palakis-mistakes`, ...) and open a Pull Request once you feel ready to show your work.

If your Pull Request is not ready to merge yet, tag it with the `work in progress` label. You can also use the `help needed` label if you have questions, need a hand or want to ask for input.

### Code style & formatting

Source code is indented with tabs, with spaces allowed for alignment.

Regarding protocol changes: new and updated request types / events must always come with accompanying documentation comments (see existing protocol elements for examples).
These are using to automatically generate the [protocol specification](docs/generated/protocol.md).

Among other recommendations: favor return-early code and avoid wrapping huge portions of code in conditionals. As an example, this:

```cpp
if (success) {
    return req->SendOKResponse();
} else {
    return req->SendErrorResponse("something went wrong");
}
```

is better like this:

```cpp
if (!success) {
    return req->SendErrorResponse("something went wrong");
}
return req->SendOKResponse();
```
